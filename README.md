# Duolingo Database Model Project

## Overview
This project focuses design and create the database structure behind Duolingo, a popular language-learning platform. The goal is to analyze and model the core components of Duolingo's system to understand how it manages users, courses, lessons, and the gamified reward system that makes it highly engaging for learners.

Duolingo leverages a structured database system to handle large amounts of user data, including progress tracking, achievements, and language lessons. By reverse-engineering this system, we aim to create a comprehensive database model that could serve as the foundation for similar educational platforms.


## Goals
- To analyze the structure of Duolingo's database.
- To model entities, attributes, and relationships that replicate its functionality.
- To optimize the design for future implementation in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
- To document findings and propose improvements for educational app development.

## Folder Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
- **/docs**: Contains documentation related to the database model and research notes.
- **/src**: The source files for database scripts and models.
- **/Project-Catch-Up-1**: [Link to folder](./Project-Catch-Up-1)  
  This folder includes catch-up material and work updates related to the projectâ€™s ongoing development.
